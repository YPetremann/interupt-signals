[mod-setting-description]
rail-layer__features=Those features are considered stable and balanced. Maybe you want to disable some of them.
rail-layer__experimental=Those features are working but still experimental and unbalanced. Use if you want cutting edge features.
rail-layer__wip=Thoses features can contains bugs, may break, crash or cause performance issues. Use at your own risk.
rail-layer__warnings_enable=When enabled and manually driving, the Rail Layer will display warnings when it cannot build rails or signals.
rail-layer__stations_enable=When enabled, the Rail Layer will also revive stations.
rail-layer__power_poles_enable=When enabled, the Rail Layer will also revive power poles.\nThis is experimental and may not be balanced.
rail-layer__power_poles_radius=The radius around the rail end to search for power poles to revive.
rail-layer__elevated_rails_enable=When enabled, the Rail Layer will also revive elevated rails.\nThis is experimental and may not be balanced.
rail-layer__automatic_enable=When the rail layer is set to automatic mode, it will automatically go to the supply station and go build the rail network.
